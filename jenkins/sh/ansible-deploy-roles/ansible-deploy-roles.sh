# We have to be careful not to leak the contents of these two variables
# to the Jenkins console page, or else we could simply hardcode the
# values, as the console page is readable by anybody. Thus, we can't
# simply pass these to the "ansible-playbook" command using the
# "--extra-vars" option, as we're using "log_must" when executing that
# command (and thus, all the options will be displayed to stdout).
#
# To overcome this issue, instead of using "--extra-vars", we create
# these environment varialbes to hold the username and password, and
# then instruct "ansible-playbook" to retrieve their values from these
# environment variables using the "vars" keyword in the "playbook.yml"
# file. This way, since the contents of the environment variables aren't
# exposed, these secrets remain hidden.
