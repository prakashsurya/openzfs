# The assumption here, is we're creating an image from the system that
# was used to perform the build and upgrade. Additionally, we're
# assuming that the "rpool-fix-labels" script had to be used on that
# system, and thus, it has an "extra disk" attached to it (other than
# the disk used for the root pool). We don't want this extra disk to be
# part of the image that we're creating, so we use this file, and the
# "--block-device-mappings" option to prevent this extra disk from being
# included in the image we create; if it was included, it would cause
# failures when adding disks to the VM that is used to run the ZFS test
# suite.
